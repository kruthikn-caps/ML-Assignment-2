 The assignment required implementing a DataLoader, defining the YOLO network architecture, creating a loss function, and training and testing the model on a cracker box dataset to achieve at least 30% Average Precision (AP) on the validation set. All tasks were completed in Python using PyTorch, designed to run on a CPU.


Install the python packages: pip install -r requirement.txt

For obtaining the training loss: run the train.py script

For obtaining the test average precision: run the test.py script
